Now that summer is over (I hope you had some good vacations), 
I hope you have the energy to do another round of RSE lightning talks! 
I let you choose the preferred date (multiple choice, with 
“Oh no, I can’t” option) and propose a lightning talk here:

Lightning Talk Date and Proposal

Looking forward to seeing you there,

Linus
