On the 5th of March 2024 we had our preparation meeting for the upcoming EPFL-RSE kickoff meeting.
We were 9 RSEs from EPFL and discussed what we want for the kickoff meeting on the 7th of May.
Discussing, we came up with the following proposition for our kickoff meeting:

- Date and time: 7th of May, 2pm-4pm
- Place: BC410 and zoom for 1st hour
- Program:
  - 2pm: Presentations (hybrid)
    - 30' - Peter Schmidt from RSE UK (confirmed): The growth of Research Software Engineering and its vital role in research
    - 15' - Gilles Dubochet (Linus asked, waiting for reply)
    - 15' - TBD (any ideas for a non-male speaker?)
  - 3pm: Topical discussions (on-site only)
    - Looking whether we want to have people assigned to topics or whether they can switch between topics

We also decided for the following tasks.
If one of them picks your interest, don't hesitate to reach out to the persons.
Or, even better, join the matrix discussion at [#rse-epfl:epfl.ch](https://matrix.c4dt.org/#/room/#rse-epfl:epfl.ch)
