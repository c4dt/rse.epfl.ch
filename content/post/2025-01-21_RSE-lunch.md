It was a fun reunion to start 2025 with some of the RSEs at EPFL.
Celebrating the birthday of one of our RSEs who prefers vegan food, we
united in the Foodlab to have a vegan dish with vegan cookies and
vegan water.
You were all patient to listen to daddy Linus and Edward telling you
stories about the "good old times" - and thanks for chiming in and
telling your stories, too!

Here some of the links I found for some the stories we told:

- [Polish trains designed to break down](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/manufacturer-deliberately-bricked-trains-repaired-by-competitors-hackers-find/)
