It was a pleasure meeting you all for the lightning talks!
Thanks for the presentators and the public for the questions.
We had the following talks:

- Carine Dengler: [Local LLMs for fun, profit and nonesense](https://cryptpad.c4dt.org/slide/#/2/slide/view/gMUekWVhsaaDPM6PA0ziecpn3qGSMs68N8nxapUQEao/present/)
- Nicolas Richart: [Spack - a package manager for HPC that can be use on any machine](./20241002-RSE_Lightning-Nicolas_Richart-SPACK.pdf)
- Uwe Schmitt (ETHZ): [pytest-regtest - a pytest plugin for snapshot testing](./20241002-RSE_Lightning-Schmitt_Uwe-pytest_regtest.pdf)

In addition, we also discussed new projects for the RSEs at EPFL and beyond.
Here is a non-binding list of ideas we had:
