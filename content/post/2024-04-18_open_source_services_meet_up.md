The Center for Digital Trust (C4DT) was excited to host our first Open Source Services Meet-Up at EPFL on March 12th. The meet-up served as an opportunity for members of EPFL's open source community to gather and share their ideas and experiences. This sharing kicked off with lightning talks which were followed by break-out sessions encouraging attendees to exchange on the subjects that they had voted for prior to the meeting. An informal lunch where participants continued their conversations over pizza concluded the event.

The presentations covered:

* Chiara Tanteri overview of the role of the DPO at EPFL,
* Charlotte Weil's presentation of the ENAC-IT service,
* Edward And√≤ introduction of the matrix.epfl.ch instance and
* Jonas Sulzer talk on the student association gnugen.

We really enjoyed hosting the meetup and would like to thank the 16 participants, especially the speakers, for taking part in it. To continue fostering open source collaborations at EPFL, the next meetup will take place in Autumn, so stay tuned for its announcement.
