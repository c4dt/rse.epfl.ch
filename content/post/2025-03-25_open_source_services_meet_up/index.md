The Center for Digital Trust (C4DT) welcomed participants from all over EPFL to the Spring edition of our Open Source Services meet-up on March 25th. As usual, the meet-up is an opportunity for EPFL's open source community to gather and exchange ideas and experiences. The first part of the meet-up was a round of lightning talks followed by break-out discussion groups to allow participants to dive deeper into the topics. The meet-up was wrapped up by an open-ended pizza lunch where participants could continue to chat about their experiences running and using OSS services at EPFL.

The presentations covered:

- ["The Email Paradox: Navigating Decentralization, Centralization, and the Future of Communication"](./The_Email_Paradox.pdf), by Jonas Sulzer and Yoan Giovannini (gnugen)
- ["LibreChat - Chat like a pro"](./Librechat.pdf), by Linus Gasser (C4DT)
- ["FOSS by/for EPFL researchers"](./FOSS_at_EPFL.pdf), by Francesco Varrato (EPFL library)

We're looking forward to the next edition in the Fall '25!
