    <p>The RSE movement started in the UK in 2012 with the
        <a href="https://society-rse.org">Society of RSE</a>.
        Their goal is to make known the work of Research Software Engineers in Universities and industry.</p>

    <h1>What is an RSE?</h1>
    Quoting <a href="https://ukrse.github.io/who.html">UK-RSE</a>:

    <blockquote>
        Regardless of your formal job title, if you answer yes to many of the following questions, you are doing the
        work of a Research Software Engineer:
        <ul>
            <li>Are you employed to develop software for research?</li>
            <li>Are you spending more time developing software than conducting research?</li>
            <li>Are you employed as a postdoctoral researcher, even though you predominantly work on software
                development?
            </li>
            <li>Are you the person who does computers in your research group?</li>
            <li>Are you sometimes not named on research papers despite playing a fundamental part in developing the
                software used to create them?
            </li>
            <li>Do you lack the metrics needed to progress your academic career, like papers and conference
                presentations, despite having made a significant contribution through software?
            </li>
        </ul>
